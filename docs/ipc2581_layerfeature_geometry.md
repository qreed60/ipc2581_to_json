# IPC-2581 LayerFeature Geometry

Phase 6.11 extracts IPC-2581 `LayerFeature` / `Set` manufacturing geometry into both aggregate summaries and normalized row-oriented geometry. These fields are intended to help review tools such as ThomsonLint inspect concrete routing evidence without re-walking the IPC XML.

## Board JSON Fields

The board export keeps all previous fields and adds row-oriented companions:

- `copper_features`: existing copper-only per-set summaries. Kept for compatibility.
- `copper_feature_summary`: existing aggregate copper dictionary. Kept unchanged.
- `copper_feature_summary_rows`: copper-only row summaries with `layer`, `net`, `feature_domain`, feature counts, descriptor refs, contour count, and `feature_count`.
- `board_feature_summary`: existing aggregate dictionary across all LayerFeature sets. Kept unchanged.
- `board_feature_summary_rows`: row summaries for copper and non-copper LayerFeature sets.
- `board_geometry_analysis`: existing per-layer aggregate feature analysis.
- `review_geometry_summary`: review-oriented net/layer, candidate, trace-width, and net routing summaries.

Example row:

```json
{
  "layer": "TOP",
  "net": "CAN_RX",
  "feature_domain": "copper",
  "polylines": 1,
  "polygons": 2,
  "pads": 2,
  "cutouts": 0,
  "contours": 2,
  "line_desc_refs": ["ROUND_500"],
  "fill_desc_refs": ["SOLID_FILL"],
  "feature_count": 5
}
```

## Normalized Routing Geometry

`routing_geometry` exposes extracted geometry in stable arrays:

- `units`: resolved IPC units when available.
- `detailed_geometry_truncated`: whether compatibility summaries were truncated.
- `feature_count`, `polyline_count`, `polygon_count`, `pad_count`, `cutout_count`.
- `routes`: normalized `Polyline` rows.
- `copper_routes`: copper-domain route rows.
- `non_copper_polylines`: fabrication, assembly, silkscreen, outline, mask, drill, or unknown drawing polylines.
- `polygons`: normalized `Contour/Polygon` rows.
- `copper_polygons` and `non_copper_polygons`.
- `pads`: normalized `Pad` rows where location metadata is available.
- `copper_pads` and `non_copper_pads`.
- `cutouts`: normalized `Cutout` rows.
- `route_counts_by_domain`: feature counts grouped by `feature_domain`.
- `route_counts_by_layer_function`: feature counts grouped by layer, layer function, and domain.

The original `routes`, `polygons`, `pads`, and `cutouts` arrays remain all-domain compatibility lists. ThomsonLint should prefer the copper-specific lists when reviewing electrical routing and use the non-copper lists only as drawing/fabrication evidence.

Route rows include `id`, `source`, `layer`, `net`, `feature_domain`, `line_desc_ref`, resolved `line_width`, `line_width_units`, ordered `points`, `bbox`, `length`, `length_units`, `length_is_estimated`, `segment_count`, `curve_count`, and `has_curve`.

Route length is reported in inches. Straight `PolyBegin` to `PolyStepSegment` spans use Euclidean distance. `PolyStepCurve` spans use parsed center and direction metadata when available; otherwise the converter uses chord length and marks `length_is_estimated: true`.

Polygon and cutout rows include ordered points, curve metadata, bounding boxes, point counts, and fill metadata where available. Pad rows include coordinates, primitive refs, xform attributes, resolved primitive geometry where possible, and bounding boxes.

Pad primitive resolution fields include:

- `standard_primitive_ref` and `user_primitive_ref`: source references preserved from IPC.
- `resolved_primitive_id`, `resolved_shape`, `resolved_width`, `resolved_height`, `resolved_diameter`, and `resolved_units`.
- `primitive_resolution_status`: `resolved`, `unresolved`, or `not_applicable`.
- `bbox`: resolved from pad location plus primitive dimensions when possible.

Missing or complex primitive dimensions remain `null`; the converter does not guess pad dimensions.

## Holes, Vias, And Drills

LayerFeature `Hole` records are normalized separately from board routes:

```json
{
  "id": "hole_000001",
  "source": "ipc2581.LayerFeature.Set.Hole",
  "net": "GND",
  "layer": "DRILL_1-6",
  "x": 1.23,
  "y": 4.56,
  "diameter": 0.013,
  "diameter_units": "INCH",
  "plating_status": "VIA",
  "hole_type": "via",
  "bbox": {}
}
```

Board JSON includes `drill_hole_summary`, `holes`, `via_holes`, `plated_holes`, and `nonplated_holes`. A hole under `LayerFeature.Set` inherits the Set net when present. This is via/hole evidence only; it is not proof of true connectivity unless the source explicitly states that relationship.

`routing_topology_summary.nets` adds `hole_count`, `via_hole_count`, `plated_hole_count`, and `nonplated_hole_count`. `routing_topology_summary.via_hole_by_net` groups hole evidence by net with counts, diameters, and layers.

## Pad And User Primitives

`pad_primitives` contains parsed `EntryStandard` geometry:

```json
{
  "id": "CIRCLE_1",
  "shape": "circle",
  "diameter": 0.024,
  "width": null,
  "height": null,
  "units": "INCH",
  "raw": {}
}
```

`user_primitives` contains compact summaries for `EntryUser` primitives. Complex user primitives are summarized rather than forced into a simple pad shape.

These fields are pad geometry evidence only. They are not annular-ring, soldermask, paste, fabrication-rule, or DRC validation.

## Package Geometry

`package_geometry_summary` separates library/package evidence from board routing:

```json
{
  "package_count": 24,
  "landpattern_pad_count": 240,
  "package_outline_polygon_count": 48,
  "assembly_drawing_polyline_count": 123,
  "assembly_drawing_polygon_count": 24,
  "silkscreen_marking_polyline_count": 81,
  "silkscreen_marking_polygon_count": 2,
  "user_primitive_polyline_count": 19,
  "user_primitive_polygon_count": 0
}
```

`package_land_patterns` gives compact per-package counts and bounding boxes. Package/library geometry must not be mixed into `routing_geometry.copper_routes`.

## Stackup Data Quality

`stackup_data_quality` is emitted in board and stack JSON:

```json
{
  "layer_names_available": true,
  "layer_order_available": true,
  "layer_function_available": true,
  "layer_side_available": true,
  "material_thickness_available": false,
  "dielectric_material_available": false,
  "copper_weight_available": false,
  "impedance_rules_available": false,
  "source": "ipc2581",
  "warnings": [
    "Material/thickness stackup details unavailable; using known ordered layer metadata."
  ]
}
```

The converter does not infer missing stackup thickness, dielectric material, copper weight, or impedance rules.

## Descriptors

`line_descriptors` is parsed from IPC `DictionaryLineDesc` / `EntryLineDesc` / `LineDesc`:

```json
{
  "id": "ROUND_500",
  "width": 0.005,
  "units": "INCH",
  "shape": "ROUND",
  "raw": {}
}
```

Routes retain their `line_desc_ref`. When a descriptor resolves, `line_width` and `line_width_units` are populated. If resolution fails, the ref is preserved and width remains `null`.

`fill_descriptors` is parsed from IPC `DictionaryFillDesc` / `EntryFillDesc` / `FillDesc`:

```json
{
  "id": "SOLID_FILL",
  "fill_type": "solid",
  "raw": {}
}
```

Polygons retain `fill_desc_ref` and include resolved fill metadata when available.

## Completeness Accounting

`routing_geometry_extraction` reports source and normalized counts:

- source object counts for polylines, polygons, pads, and cutouts.
- normalized counts for routes, polygons, pads, and cutouts.
- non-copper polyline and polygon counts.
- truncation metadata.
- `dropped_or_unparsed_feature_count`.
- `parse_warnings` for geometry objects that were counted but had incomplete parsed details.

The converter should not silently drop LayerFeature objects. If source counts exceed normalized counts, the difference is reported.

## Review Summary

`review_geometry_summary` still includes `net_layer_presence`, `net_feature_totals`, `routing_candidates`, `pad_only_nets`, `line_width_ref_usage`, `fill_ref_usage`, and name-based `candidate_differential_or_paired_nets`.

Phase 6.11 also adds:

- `routing_geometry_available`.
- `routing_geometry_counts`.
- `trace_width_usage`: resolved width usage by line descriptor, route count, and nets.
- `net_routing_summary`: per-net route, polygon, pad, cutout, layer, trace width, descriptor, and bounding-box summary.

## Routing Topology Summary

Phase 6.12 adds compact topology-oriented summaries so review agents do not need to walk every normalized route row for common questions.

`routing_topology_summary` is the canonical location for agentic review topology summaries. Board-root `trace_width_by_net`, `trace_width_usage_by_layer`, `route_length_by_net`, and `route_length_by_layer` are retained as backward-compatible aliases when present.

`routing_topology_summary` contains:

- `units`.
- `net_count`, `routed_net_count`, `pad_only_net_count`, `plane_candidate_count`, and `paired_net_candidate_count`.
- `nets`: one row per logical or geometry-bearing net.
- `paired_net_geometry_comparison`: compact geometry comparison rows for name-based paired-net candidates.
- `layer_transition_candidates`: conservative multi-layer copper evidence rows.
- `trace_width_by_net`: compact per-routed-net trace width summary.
- `trace_width_usage_by_layer`: compact per-layer and per-line-descriptor usage summary.
- `route_length_by_net`: approximate per-net route length summary.
- `route_length_by_layer`: approximate per-layer route length summary.
- `via_hole_by_net`: hole/via evidence grouped by net.
- `routing_evidence_warnings`: deterministic review hints.
- `limitations`: caveats specific to the topology summary.

Per-net topology rows include:

```json
{
  "net": "CAN_RX",
  "layers": ["TOP"],
  "route_count": 1,
  "polygon_count": 2,
  "pad_count": 2,
  "cutout_count": 0,
  "line_desc_refs": ["ROUND_500"],
  "min_trace_width": 0.005,
  "max_trace_width": 0.005,
  "bbox": {},
  "has_top_copper": true,
  "has_bottom_copper": false,
  "has_internal_copper": false,
  "has_plane_evidence": false,
  "is_plane_candidate": false,
  "is_pad_only": false,
  "is_routing_candidate": true,
  "hole_count": 0,
  "via_hole_count": 0,
  "plated_hole_count": 0,
  "nonplated_hole_count": 0,
  "geometry_evidence": [
    "1 route/polyline on TOP",
    "2 polygons on TOP",
    "2 pads on TOP",
    "trace width refs: ROUND_500"
  ]
}
```

`routing_topology_summary.trace_width_by_net` contains one row per routed net:

```json
{
  "net": "CAN_RX",
  "line_desc_refs": ["ROUND_500"],
  "min_trace_width": 0.005,
  "max_trace_width": 0.005,
  "route_count": 1,
  "layers": ["TOP"]
}
```

`routing_topology_summary.trace_width_usage_by_layer` groups normalized copper routes by layer and `LineDescRef`:

```json
{
  "layer": "TOP",
  "line_desc_ref": "ROUND_500",
  "line_width": 0.005,
  "units": "INCH",
  "route_count": 123,
  "nets": ["CAN_RX"]
}
```

Trace widths come from IPC-2581 `LineDescRef` resolution against `DictionaryLineDesc` / `EntryLineDesc` / `LineDesc`. If a descriptor is missing or cannot be resolved, the descriptor reference is preserved and width fields remain `null`; the converter does not guess widths.

These trace-width summaries are evidence indexes for review. They are not DRC, impedance, spacing, skew, route-length, or length-matching verification.

`routing_topology_summary.route_length_by_net` contains one row per routed copper net:

```json
{
  "net": "CAN_RX",
  "total_route_length": 0.1432,
  "length_units": "INCH",
  "route_count": 1,
  "layers": ["TOP"],
  "length_is_estimated": false,
  "estimated_route_count": 0,
  "curve_count": 0,
  "min_route_length": 0.1432,
  "max_route_length": 0.1432
}
```

`routing_topology_summary.route_length_by_layer` groups route length by copper layer:

```json
{
  "layer": "TOP",
  "total_route_length": 12.34,
  "length_units": "INCH",
  "route_count": 123,
  "net_count": 45,
  "estimated_route_count": 0,
  "nets": ["CAN_RX"]
}
```

These route length fields are approximate geometry summaries from normalized IPC-2581 routes. They are not live CAD constraints and are not spacing, impedance, skew, timing, or length-matching verification.

## Paired-Net Geometry Comparison

`paired_net_geometry_comparison` is generated from `review_geometry_summary.candidate_differential_or_paired_nets`. It reports each pair, candidate reason, whether geometry is available, compact rows for each net, and comparison booleans/deltas such as same layer set, same trace-width refs, route count delta, polygon count delta, pad count delta, possible bounding-box overlap, and route length estimate fields:

- `route_length_a`
- `route_length_b`
- `route_length_delta`
- `route_length_delta_units`
- `route_length_ratio`
- `length_is_estimated`

These rows do not infer that the pair is correctly routed, matched, or mismatched. They do not verify impedance, coupling, spacing, skew, timing, or length matching.

## ThomsonLint Consumption Guidance

Use `routing_geometry.copper_routes`, `copper_polygons`, and `copper_pads` for electrical routing review. Use `non_copper_polylines`, non-copper polygons, package summaries, and user primitives as contextual drawing/library evidence only.

Use `drill_hole_summary`, `holes`, `via_holes`, and `routing_topology_summary.via_hole_by_net` to cite hole/via evidence by net. Do not treat this as proven via connectivity unless the source explicitly provides that association.

Use `stackup_data_quality` before making stackup-dependent statements. If material/thickness or impedance fields are unavailable, ThomsonLint should avoid impedance or stackup-derived conclusions.

## Layer Transition Candidates

`layer_transition_candidates` identifies nets with copper evidence on multiple copper layers. The converter may have pad, hole, drill, or via-related data elsewhere, but this field intentionally uses conservative candidate language.

Do not treat a layer transition candidate as proof of actual via connectivity unless explicit via or hole association by net is present and reviewed separately.

## Plane Candidates

Plane candidate detection is heuristic and evidence-based. A net is not a plane candidate merely because it has pads on internal layers, appears on many layers, or has small top/bottom polygons around pads.

Stronger evidence is required, such as:

- power/ground-style net name plus polygon or cutout evidence.
- high cutout count on an internal layer.
- multiple polygons or cutouts on an internal plane layer.
- layer metadata indicating `PLANE` with non-pad copper geometry.
- large copper bounding-box evidence combined with polygon or cutout geometry.

Candidate reasons cite specific evidence, for example `GND has 682 cutouts on LAYER3` or `V3P3 has 314 cutouts on LAYER4`.

## Limitations

The converter does not prove electrical or manufacturing correctness from these summaries alone:

- Geometry is extracted from IPC-2581 manufacturing/export features, not from live CAD constraints.
- Route length is computed from exported IPC-2581 route geometry and is approximate.
- Arc/curve length may be estimated where exact curve semantics are limited.
- No true clearance DRC is performed.
- No net-short or spacing verification is performed.
- No impedance, skew, timing, or length-matching verification is performed.
- No annular-ring or soldermask validation is performed.
- No proven via connectivity is inferred unless explicitly present in the IPC source.
- No polygon boolean connectivity verification is performed.
- Line width references are reported and resolved when possible, but not validated against design rules unless explicit rules are provided.
- Differential/paired nets are name-based candidates only.
- Plane candidate detection is heuristic and evidence-based.

Do not conclude that a plane is correct, a route is connected, or a differential pair is impedance controlled from these geometry and topology summaries alone. Use them to decide what ThomsonLint should inspect next and to cite concrete extracted evidence in findings.
